                <p> I was born in Chicago and lived there until I was 10, then moved to Cleveland for about 8 years, and my family moved to Tampa right as I was beginning college. I started out playing D1 soccer at La Salle University in Philadelphia until I transferred back to Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. At CWRU I led my team to an Elite 8 appearance and was named an All-American, probably my biggest accomplishment yet. </p>

            <p> I major in Mechanical Engineering at Case, but am more interested in software development as I search for my first job. I'm a very motivated and detail-oriented person, so I think this type of career path suits me well. </p>
            <p> In my free time, I like to socialize with friends, go golfing, travel, and cook. I also really like animals and have two dogs at home, a yorkshire terrier named Sophie and a havanese named Zeke. </p>
