Instructions:
1. Start game by pressing any key as your first guess
2. Continue until you are out of attempts or you have guessed correctly.
3. Once Step 2 is completed, a new team will pop up for you to guess.
4. Wins are tallied... try to get all of them correct!
CAUTION: Guessing the same letter 2+ times will cost you a guess, so be mindful of what you have already guessed.
